1.	What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The problem that we were trying to solve for the course was to take the role of a software engineer and design a program for ABC University. The program needed to be able to read in a list of courses from a file, store it in a data structure of our choice (binary search tree for mine) then display them in various ways for the user.
2.	How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

For me, I looked at the entirety of the project and saw that the two requirements for user interaction were an alphabetized list and a search function. Of the three data structures we could choose from I picked BST because it seemed to be a great middle ground. A regular vector could be alphabetized while loading but would be slower to search. A hash table would have to be alphabetized when the user asked for a list but would search quickly. A binary search tree would be alphabetized when it was stored and would be able to find the information in a O(log n) worse case search, which isn’t bad.
3.	How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

I would say the biggest roadblock I encountered working on this project was making sure that binary search tree was working. Though I had a frame work to go off of from previous work it still took some work to make sure I understood exactly what was working. I over came this by having my trusty iPad with me and drawing out the program processes as I went to help me visualize what was going on in program.
4.	How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

I knew visualization was important, both from previous classes and from watching a lot of programing videos online that stress planning and visualizing first before touching the code (specifically thinking of Daniel Shiffman’s Coding Train on YouTube) but this project really showed me how true that was through both working with a digital white board on my iPad as well as utilizing flowcharts prior to the coding. Both are something I will be taking with me through my career.
5.	How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Besides the answer I put in the last question. I would say the way that I write that has changed is that working with the binary search trees really shows me the importance of keeping things modular. Each function of the tree can be broken apart into its own thing from going pre or post order, loading the tree, removing a node, searching; Each Item can be separated into its own individual part and even not included at all if it is not required. I feel like this can be applied to many different places inside of the umbrella of coding and will help me write code in the future that is more maintainable, readable and adaptive.
