1. How do I approach designing software? 
	○ When it comes to designing software, I usually approach it the same way I would approach solving a puzzle. First I make sure I fully understand the problem, see what the instructions or requirements are and get a feel for exactly what is being asked. Next I look at the context of the problem, is this for school? Is this a personal project? This helps shapes the interpretation of the requirements. The next thing I do is map out the program on a something easy to erase like a white board or a tablet. This step has become very valuable to me and helps quickly find areas I need to focus on, and things I would have otherwise not considered. For this project specifically, I wrote down the objects I wanted to do from the beginning, and did a quick sketch of my desk. I later took that sketch and a ruler and measured all the pieces I wanted so I could have a standard sense of scale across the image. 
	
2. How do I approach developing programs? 
	○ Developing the program was a fun time. To start with I organized all the objects I wanted to make into their own separate functions, I knew I wanted to use a lot of meshes and wanted to be able to keep them organized and turn them on and off as needed. This also helped me work on them in a milestone fashion where I could continue to add objects without having to modify previous work. Next I knew I wanted to be able to easily readjust whole objects without moving every single piece so I set a common factor each X,Y,Z was added to. With this I could adjust that common factor, and everything moved the same amount. Lastly,  I made the whole thing fairly module where I had all the code I needed for an individual piece and I would just copy and paste and adjust the variables. So if I knew I wanted to make a cylinder for one part I would have my OneNote file open on a another screen with the snippets I needed and I would put in each part I needed. It reminded me a lot of a painter who had a pallet of colors available and would dip into what they needed ( "I need a SetTexture and a CreateCylinderMesh" for instance).

3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals? 
	○ My primary goals upon leaving the Navy is to be able to care for my family and get a job on back end development. I really enjoy the puzzle like nature of programming and every time I read through new code I feel like I am a spelunker exploring a new and interesting cave with its many unique features and branches. Computer science will help me with both of those goals because it will give me the information and resources I need to be able to seek employment in that field  and continued to give me new and unique tools to explore and examine code. Software Engineering is a field that isn't going away any time soon (despite AI naysayers) and I plan on following it to its fullest.
